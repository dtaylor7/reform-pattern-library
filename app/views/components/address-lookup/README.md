This example shows the interaction, but it doesn't contain the correct code.

If you plan to use this pattern in your prototype, consider copying the code from the [divorce prototype](http://submit-online-pay.herokuapp.com/respondent/address/postcode) (see password at bottom of page). This pattern also shows how to enter the address manually.

When building this pattern then use the Apply for a Divorce [frontend code](https://git.reform.hmcts.net/divorce/frontend) (requires VPN) as this also handles cases where a user doesn't have Javascript installed.

## Example

> For this example, enter these postcodes: **NW1 5DA** or **NW1 4QA**.

```example
{{ reformAddressLookup() }}
```

## Research for this pattern

This pattern was researched, developed and extensively tested during the [Apply for a Divorce](http://submit-online-pay.herokuapp.com/respondent/address/postcode) project.
