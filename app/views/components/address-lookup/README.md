## Research for this pattern

This pattern was researched, developed and extensively tested during the [Apply for a Divorce](http://divorce-prototype-print-post.herokuapp.com/respondent/address/postcode) project. When implementing this pattern, referring to the Apply for a Divorce frontend code would be advisable, since it handles cases where a user doesn't have Javascript installed.
