## Example

> For this example, enter these postcodes: **NW1 5DA** or **NW1 4QA**.

```example
{{ reformAddressLookup() }}
```

## How to use this pattern 

This example shows the interaction, but it doesn't contain the correct code.

If you plan to use this pattern in your prototype, consider copying the code from the [divorce prototype](http://submit-online-pay.herokuapp.com/respondent/address/postcode) (see password at bottom of page). When building this pattern then use the Apply for a Divorce [frontend code](https://git.reform.hmcts.net/divorce/frontend) as this also handles cases where a user doesn't have Javascript installed.

## Research for this pattern

This pattern was researched, developed and extensively tested during the [Apply for a Divorce](http://submit-online-pay.herokuapp.com/respondent/address/postcode) project. When implementing this pattern, referring to the Apply for a Divorce frontend code would be advisable, since it handles cases where a user doesn't have Javascript installed.
